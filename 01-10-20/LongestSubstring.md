# Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** in it **with no more than K distinct characters**.

#### Example 1

```
Input: String="brbbci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "brbb".
```

#### Example 2

```
Input: String="brbbci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "bb".
```

#### Example 3

```
Input: String="caaeai", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "caaea" & "aaeai".
```

### Try solving the problem by contibuting your answers in a different file using one of the following languages

#### Java

```java
class LongestSubstringKDistinct {
  public static int findLength(String str, int k) {
    // TODO: Write your code here
    return -1;
  }
}
```
#### Python

const longest_substring_with_k_distinct = function(str, k) {
  // TODO: Write your code here
  return -1;
};
```

#### C++

```c++
class LongestSubstringKDistinct {
 public:
  static int findLength(const string& str, int k) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    // TODO: Write your code here
    return maxLength;
  }
};
```
